# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

# What is Amazon Cognito
- Amazon Cognito is a service that allows authentication authorization & user management for the web & mobile applications with users that it stores locally in the Amazon account
- Amazon cognito user pool uses oauth authentication (google, facebook, github e.t.c). These are directories which dispense sign-up & sign-in choices to the application users.
-  Amazon cognito Identity pool requires entry credentials from a user (grant access to AWS services). 
   These enable you to grant your users access to other AWS services.
    Both these components can either be used separately or together.
