# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
   *  Learned how to set up billing alerts and alarms on my AWS account, and 
      successfully set this up in my account
   *  Successfully created budgets and billing alarms
   *  Learned how to use the Billing Calculator and AWS credits
   *  Watched a helpful video by Chirag (https://www.youtube.com/watch? 
      v=OVw3RrlP-sI&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=13) that explained the steps clearly 

# Create IAM user
   * Successfully created Admin Group with AdminstrativeAccess
   * Successfully created a user and added the user to the group
   * Successfully created Access Control
   * Added an MFA to the user account for security

# Install AWS CLI
   * Successfully installed AWS CLI on my gitpod
   * Watched a helpful video by Andrew Brown (https://www.youtube.com/watch? 
     v=OdUnNuKylHg&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=14) and followed the official documentation from AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

# Creating Diagrams with Lucid chart
- This week, I learned about the Iron Triangle which is a concept that refers to the three main      constraints that are inherent in every project. The constraints are Scope, time and cost. The concept suggests that  these three constraints are interdependent, and any change to one constraint will impact the other two. For example, if the project scope is expanded, it may require more time and resources to complete, which can increase the cost of the project. Similarly, if the project timeline is shortened, it may require more resources and increase the cost of the project. Project managers need to balance these three constraints throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and with the expected scope and quality. The Iron Triangle concept is a useful framework for understanding these trade-offs and managing the project accordingly.

- I also learned about TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework). It is a popular enterprise architecture framework that provides a comprehensive approach to designing, planning, implementing, and managing enterprise information technology architecture. TOGAF is based on a four-phase Architecture Development Method (ADM) that provides a structured and iterative approach to creating an enterprise architecture. The four phases are:

   - Architecture Vision: In this phase, the enterprise architecture team develops a high-level vision of the enterprise architecture and aligns it with the strategic goals of the organization.

   - Architecture Definition: In this phase, the enterprise architecture team creates a detailed architecture plan, including the baseline architecture, target architecture, gap analysis, and migration plan.

   - Architecture Development: In this phase, the enterprise architecture team develops the components of the enterprise architecture, such as the technology infrastructure, application architecture, and data architecture.

  - Architecture Implementation: In this phase, the enterprise architecture team implements the components of the enterprise architecture, such as installing hardware and software, migrating data, and integrating systems.

- I was able to recreate the Cruddur Logical diagram. This was a bit challenging but this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6FDrI_tz0k&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=18 from Andrew Brown was very helful. Here's what my diagram looks like. I know it can be improved.
